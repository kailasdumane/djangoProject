			This is our first HTML website. In this website we have implemented all that we have learned in this course.
			HTML or HyperText Markup Language is markup language that we use for creating HTML documents that web browsers 
			(Google Chrome, Internet Explorer etc.) will convert to web pages. 
							
			HTML <mark>is not a programming language</mark>, it is Markup Language so you will not use it to do some data processing 
			or anything like that, you will use HTML for to creating just visual representation of your website.
							
			Every HTML document contains HTML tags and HTML elements. Every single element of your website (text, button, image) 
			is HTML element or HTML tag.
			HTML tag is letter or word surrounded with less than sign (<b> < </b>) and greater than sign (<b> > </b>) or letter or 
			word surrounded with less than sign and forward slash (<b> < / </b>) and greater than sign (<b> > </b>).
			<u>This is start HTML tag:</u> <i>< startTag ></i> and <u>this is end HTML tag:</u>  <i>< /endTag ></i>
			HTML element is content surrounded with start HTML tag and end HTML tag.
			<u>This is HTML element:</u> <i>< startTag > Some content < /endTag ></i>
			<u>This is an empty or self closing HTML element:</u> <i>< selfClosingElement /></i>
							
			Every website on internet is written in HTML. HTML is designed in the early 90's and from then until now it is starting 
			point for learning web development. So congratulations on making your first step and enjoy!
